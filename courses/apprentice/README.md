#### Apprenticeships

Once a student has successfully completed the LC101 skill track and has demonstrated proficiency with a capstone project, this person will be eligible and encouraged to apply to be a LaunchCode apprentice.

As students emerge as candidates and are trained in job preparedness, candidates will be eligible for interviewing for apprenticeships.  

Apprenticeships tend to range from about 90-120 day on the job experience at the company where hired, positions with mentoring from the partnering company.
