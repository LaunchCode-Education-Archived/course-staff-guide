### What is LC101?

LC101 is a technology skill building course developed by LaunchCode, used to help foster growth and learning for the purpose of putting a student on a competitive path to obtaining a job in the quickly expanding field of tech. We specifically developed this course to teach a wide range of students skills that are in high demand within the tech community. LC101 includes a rigorous curriculum taught by a supportive teaching and mentoring staff, providing an incoming and active student with world-class resources to begin, continue, and refine one's skills in computer programming. 

To help students work through the rigorous curriculum and succeed, LaunchCode has designed a success yielding 3-unit online course learning track. A lead instructor guides students through the material with strong support from teaching fellows and local developers assisting in instruction and providing support. Students have acces to in-person mentoring and are instructed,encouraged and coached through the entirety of the LC101 experience, in-class and out-of-class. Through the combined efforts of staff and volunteers as well as using a world-class curriculum, LauchCode is happy to offer students an experience and opportunity to pursue advancement in the realm of technology.

LC101 is currently set up as a 20-week class, designed to teach the skills necessary to begin a carrer in technology.  A student is expected to spend at least 20 hours a week on coursework, this includes spending time in class.  The classes are set up to meet twice a week, 3-hour sessions each date. For success, a student is expected to spend 10-15 hours doing readings, watching videos, working on practice exercises, and completing coding assignments.

For the student, this is a pass/fail course.  In order to pass, a student must complete all of the required assignments by the end of the Unit. Students who do not complete the required assignments will not pass.
