### 3-Unit Learning Track for LC101

Link | Summary
|------------|-------------|
[Unit 1, Programming Fundamentals](#unit-1) | The core of coding
[Unit 2, Web Fundamentals](#unit-2)  | The basics of web programming
[Unit 3, Java or C#](#unit-3) | Back-end skill tracks oriented to job-ready skills

### Unit 1

Students will learn Python in Unit 1.  

__*Think Python* is an online text used for Unit 1,  introducing students to fundamental concepts in procedural programming along with object-oriented basics.__

Unit 1 focuses on core, universal programming concepts.  Currently, Python is the language in which these concepts are taught.  Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to employ the followng programming concepts:

__Statements__
   - Declare and initialize variables
   - Assign values to variables
   - Use and call functions provided by the programming languages's standard libraries

__Data Types__ 
   - Determine/define the type of a given variable
   - Convert data values from one type to another
   - Properly identify and use data types based on the domain of a given problem.

__Operators__
   - Use common boolean operators
   - Use commin arithmetic operators
   - Concatenate strings and lists

### Unit 2

Web fundamentals covers concepts for building full-stack web applications.

Unit 2 covers the foundational elements of a modern web application, with the notable exception of Javascript. Students will learn basic web languages and professional web developer tools, preparing them to eventually work on either front-end or back-end applications. 

Topics and Skills
- HTML: tags, forms, and semantics
- CSS: selectors and style rules		
- Information storage: using relational databases / MySQL 
- Handling HTTP requests in a web application
- Object-relational mapping
- Version control using Git and GitHub
- Form validation
- Templating
- Secure data storage (salting and hashing)
- Model-View-Controller design for web applications
- Cookies
- Bootstrap


### Unit 3
