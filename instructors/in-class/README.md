#### Keeping Students on Track

Students will fall behind during the course.  If a student is showing signs of disengagement or stuggle, please engage with the student and ask questions such as "What are you working on?"

The TF's are often working with students in groups.  Students can be tracked by asking the TF's where the students are and how are the students generally performing.  

Having just a general feeling of how the overall student population is helpful when coming to address the students who are off track.  Sometimes to get a student on track, it is as simple as asking a question or helping the student set a goal.  There are times when remediation discussions and plans may be of the best benefit.  

It may be best for students who get caught in a struggle and tough spot to ffer students time to meet with you or the TF to work on a plan of recovery, flush out issues or blockages to learning, open up about difficulties.

Even a brief mention or speaking to a student, addressing the student by name may encourage and help that student through the next turn.
