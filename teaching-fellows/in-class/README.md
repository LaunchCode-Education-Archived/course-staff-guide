## Attendance
Each day, TF's take attendance, marking each student in their group either present, absent, or excused.
The gradebook is on Canvas.  After orientation, the TF will know exactly where to log daily attendance records.

## Grading
In unit 1, students will submit grades through Vocareum.  The application will grade student submissions.  

In Unit 2 and Unit 3, students will have to demo their assignments to you as a TF in order to be graded.  Once demoed, please submit the grade in the gradebook for the appropriate assignment.
