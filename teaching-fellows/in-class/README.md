## Attendance
Each day, TF's take attendance, marking each student in their group either present, absent, or excused.
The gradebook is on Canvas.  After orientation, the TF will know exactly where to log daily attendance records.

## Grading
In unit 1, students will submit grades through Vocareum.  The application will grade student submissions.  

In Unit 2 and Unit 3, students will have to demo their assignments to you as a TF in order to be graded.  Once demoed, please submit the grade in the gradebook for the appropriate assignment.

## How to Lead a group/review session

Write the agenda for your session on the whiteboard.
This helps the students get the big picture and helps you stay on track.
    Example:
    Check-in/warm up
    Q&A about lecture topics
    Discussion of goals
    Studio overview
    Studio work
    Studio presentation
    Break & stretch
    Bonus problems
    Bonus problem work
    Bonus presentation
    Close

The no list
    no need to lecture about code
    don't write code on the whiteboard unless you wr
    don't use fading markers

## Pairing facilitation

In pair programming, an agile software development technique, two programmers work together, in the case of LC101, to solve a studio problem. One team member is the driver, this is the person who writes the code or types it into the laptop.  The other team member is the navigator, the person who reviews the code being written. Roles can be switched frequently.

Students get the opportunity to share aloud.  Each student will bring her or his own views to the solution. Solutions are usually reached quickly.  Programming in pairs helps build student confidence.

As the TF, you will help the students get into pairs.  It is good to encourage switching and rotation of pairs on diffent studios or problem sets, offering students the opportunity to work with a variety of personalities.

Just as a note, a silent partner is not collaborating, if this occurs, please ask the silent team member a question such as "what do you think we should do here?"
 
## Keeping students engaged

When a student is disengaged, it is usually a sign that  a student is not comprehending the lesson or is lost.  The end result of seeing and letting a student stay disengaged is usually low performance.  Please take to the time to intervene and help the students stay engaged, contributing to an environment of support and enabling of good work practices.

When there are class sessions for LC101, students are in an "active learning environment". It is important for students to take advantage of in person class sessions and stay engaged with the material.  Please help students be able to demonstrate coding with you.
