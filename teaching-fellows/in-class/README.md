### Attendance

Each class after the first part which is typically instructor led lecture, students will gather into their TF groups in designated areas. TFs are expected to take attendance by marking a student‚Äôs in-class activities (üê• Class 1.1, üê• Class 1.2, üê• Class 2.1 etc.) as complete (‚úî), incomplete (‚®Ø) or excused (EX). Please make note of anyone who has missed two consecutive classes. If you are concerned about a student‚Äôs progress, please reach out to them. If you are struggling to work with Canvas that day, please email the attendance sheet for your group to the Class Success Manager.

### Checking in on Students

You do not have to check in with every student each class period - generally, make sure you get to each student at least once a week.

For students who are falling behind, take the time to see what they‚Äôre struggling with and what might be preventing them from making progress. Make sure to give every student proper attention, though you may find that some need more than others. Be sure to get in the habit of talking to everyone from time to time so they can feel comfortable reaching out to you if they have problems.

### Grading

For Unit 1, students submit their assignments to an online grading platform called Vocareum. There will be grading scripts that automatically test whether the student‚Äôs code is correct or not. It will also give the student feedback if their code doesn‚Äôt pass a specific test case.

During Units 2 and 3, students will submit their assignments to Github and submit their Github links to Canvas, but will also need to  ‚Äúdemo‚Äù them to their TF. You will be given a brief checklist/rubric of what to look for, and then can mark their assignment as completed. This is a good opportunity for you to give feedback and ask students about their code. If a Floater TF is not covering another group for the day, he/she can demo assignments while Group TFs focus on students‚Äô questions.

### Keeping students engaged

When a student is disengaged, it is usually a sign that  a student is not comprehending the lesson or is lost.  The end result of seeing and letting a student stay disengaged is usually low performance.  Please take to the time to intervene and help the students stay engaged, contributing to an environment of support and enabling of good work practices.

When there are class sessions for LC101, students are in an "active learning environment". It is important for students to take advantage of in person class sessions and stay engaged with the material.  Please help students be able to demonstrate coding with you.  

### Leading Studios

After attendance, students will work in small groups on a Studio given to them in lecture. As a TF, your role is to facilitate the completion of this studio, preferably in small group of 2-3 people. Group TFs can use this time to assist students with questions, and also to check in with students individually.

### Pairing facilitation

In pair programming, an agile software development technique, two programmers work together, in the case of LC101, to solve a studio problem. One team member is the driver, this is the person who writes the code or types it into the laptop.  The other team member is the navigator, the person who reviews the code being written. Roles can be switched frequently.

Students get the opportunity to share aloud.  Each student will bring her or his own views to the solution. Solutions are usually reached quickly.  Programming in pairs helps build student confidence.

As the TF, you will help the students get into pairs.  It is good to encourage switching and rotation of pairs on diffent studios or problem sets, offering students the opportunity to work with a variety of personalities.

Just as a note, a silent partner is not collaborating, if this occurs, please ask the silent team member a question such as "what do you think we should do here?"
 
### Tips on how to lead a small group session

(credit to Al Zimmerman, Portland Instructor)

Write the agenda for your session on a whiteboard.  This helps the students get the big picture and helps you stay on track.
    
Example:
 - Check-in/warm up
 -   Q&A about lecture topics
 -   Discussion of goals
 -   Studio overview
 -   Studio work
 -   Studio presentation
 -   Break & stretch
 -   Bonus problems
 -   Bonus problem work
 -   Bonus presentation
 -  Close

Helpful hints:
- no need to lecture about code
- don't write code on the whiteboard unless you writing is good
- don't use fading markers
