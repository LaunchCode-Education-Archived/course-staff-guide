For in-class issues, the TF can report issues directly to the class instructor.

If issues need to be communicated in writing, it is best to email the classroom success managers. This information ought to have been given to you during oriention.  If there is a question in who is your class success manager, please review orientation materials or ask the lead instructor.

You may too communicate via your LaunchCode Slack channel.
