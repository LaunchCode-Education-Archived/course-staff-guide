### Teaching Fellow Activities Outside of Class

As contracted TFs are expected to spend a minimum of four hours each week in class. You can use your outside of class hours in the following suggested ways:

- Reviewing and answering student questions on Slack. Students will often have questions outside of class, and this is a great way to assist students through challenges.
- Offer and meet with your TF group for review sessions and study sessions.
