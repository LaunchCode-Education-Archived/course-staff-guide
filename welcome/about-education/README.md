### Curriculum

The LaunchCode curriculum is driven and guided by our apprenticeship program.  Through our apprenticeship program, we make sure to stay updated wht the technology market, seeing what skills are most in-demand.  

Although there are a lot of fascinating topics that we would like to cover, we make our classes as efficient as possible. For the sake of the student moving into apprenticeships and successful careers in technology, we choose to focus on skills and technologies that are broadly applicable and widely used.  We strive to facilitata a learning environment that mimics workplace practices.

### Focus and Practice

At LaunchCode, we believe that the best way to learn how to code is to actually code.  Our focus is on job readiness.  We are always looking at and thinking about how to improve the curriculum, to teach best practices, and to facilitate a beneficial learning environment.  

Learning to code for our students is about using code to solve problems.  Assignments are geared to help students solve real-life problems and challenge students to come up with solutions using technological tools.
