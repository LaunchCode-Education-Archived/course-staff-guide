### Contributions
    As instructors and teaching fellows, you provide an invaluable service to our students by guiding people through the LC101 world-class curriculum.  
    
    As you are ever present in the field and working with students, we appreciate any interest and feedback in ways to deliver our serves better and to maintain a great environment and workflow for our students.

    We encourage and support any comments from your perspective.  Please feel free to share on Slack, with a Class success manager, and or directly with the home office in St. Louis.
